### Platform Features
- **Biometric Authentication**: Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint
- **Local Encryption**: AES-256 with device keystore
- **Background Processing**: Proof-of-life notifications
- **Secure Storage**: Platform-specific secure storage

## 🎯 Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Offline-First Design
- All functionality works without internet connection
- Local data storage with SQLite
- Secure local encryption for all sensitive data
- Network requests only for non-sensitive operations

### 2. Security-First Approach
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- End-to-end encryption for all user data
- Biometric authentication as primary security layer
- No sensitive data transmission to external servers

### 3. Modular Architecture
- Feature-based module organization
- Reusable UI components and widgets
- Separation of concerns between layers
- Clean architecture principles

### 4. Cross-Platform Consistency
- Shared business logic across platforms
- Platform-specific UI adaptations
- Native platform integration where needed
- Consistent user experience

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Follow code review process
4. Merge after approval and tests pass

### 2. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Security testing for encryption features

### 3. Code Quality
- Dart analysis with `flutter_lints`
- Code formatting with `dart format`
- Documentation for public APIs
- Performance profiling for critical paths

## 🚀 Getting Started
