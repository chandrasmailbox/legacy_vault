# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Q: Is my data safe with Legacy Vault?
**A:** Yes. Legacy Vault uses military-grade encryption and stores all data locally on your device. Your passwords never leave your device and are not stored on any servers.

### Q: Can Legacy Vault staff access my passwords?
**A:** No. Legacy Vault uses zero-knowledge architecture, meaning we cannot access your data even if we wanted to. All encryption and decryption happens on your device.

### Q: What happens if I lose my device?
**A:** Your data is encrypted and tied to your biometric authentication. Without your biometric data or backup PIN, the data cannot be accessed. You should set up your vault again on a new device.

### Q: How does the inheritance system work securely?
**A:** The inheritance system uses local encryption and secure transfer protocols. Data is only accessible to designated family members after proper verification and waiting periods.

## üì± Device & Installation

### Q: Which devices are supported?
**A:** Legacy Vault supports:
- iOS 15.0+ on iPhone 12 and newer
- Android 8.0+ (API level 26+) with biometric capability

### Q: Why do I need biometric authentication?
**A:** Biometric authentication ensures that only you can access your vault. It's more secure than passwords and provides quick, convenient access.

### Q: Can I use Legacy Vault without biometrics?
**A:** While biometric authentication is strongly recommended, you can use a backup PIN. However, this reduces security and is not recommended for sensitive data.

### Q: How much storage space does Legacy Vault need?

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Family & Inheritance

**A:** You need their name, relationship to you, email address, and phone number. This ensures they can be contacted when needed.

### Q: Can family members access my vault while I'm alive?
**A:** No. Family members can only access inherited passwords after the inheritance process is triggered by missed proof-of-life check-ins.

### Q: What if I add the wrong family member?
**A:** You can edit or remove family members at any time through the Family Management section.

### Q: How do family members receive their inheritance?

## ‚è∞ Proof of Life System

### Q: What is a proof-of-life check-in?
**A:** A proof-of-life check-in is a simple confirmation that you're alive and well. You receive notifications asking you to open the app and confirm your status.

### Q: How often do I need to check in?
**A:** You can set the frequency during setup: weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. You can change this anytime in settings.

### Q: What happens if I miss a check-in?
**A:** If you miss a check-in, you'll receive additional reminders. After multiple missed check-ins, the inheritance process begins with a configurable delay period.

### Q: Can I check in early?
**A:** Yes, you can check in anytime by opening the app. Early check-ins reset the timer.

### Q: What if I'm traveling or unable to check in?
**A:** You can temporarily extend your check-in period through the app settings, or ask your emergency contact to verify your status.

**A:** Yes. Each password can be set as:
- **Inherited**: Passed to family members
- **Restricted**: Limited inheritance with conditions
- **Excluded**: Not inherited

### Q: What's the password generator feature?
**A:** The password generator creates strong, random passwords with customizable length and character sets to improve your security.
