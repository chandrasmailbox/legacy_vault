# Digital Will Setup

The Digital Will is the core feature that distinguishes Legacy Vault from traditional password managers. It provides automated inheritance of your digital assets through a sophisticated proof-of-life monitoring system.

## üéØ Overview

The Digital Will system automatically monitors your activity and triggers inheritance procedures when you're no longer able to check in. This ensures your family members can access important digital assets when needed, while protecting against false alarms.

### Key Components
- **Proof-of-Life Monitoring**: Regular check-ins to verify you're active
- **Dead Man's Switch**: Automated inheritance trigger system
- **Emergency Contacts**: Designated contacts for urgent situations
- **Inheritance Delay**: Configurable waiting period before inheritance
- **Secure Transfer**: Encrypted inheritance package delivery

## üöÄ Initial Setup

### Step 1: Understanding the Digital Will
The setup wizard begins with an explanation of how the digital will works:

1. **Proof-of-Life Check-ins**: You'll receive regular reminders to confirm you're active
2. **Missed Check-in Process**: Missing check-ins triggers a countdown timer
3. **Emergency Contact Notification**: Emergency contacts are alerted during countdown
4. **Inheritance Activation**: After the delay period, inheritance begins
5. **Family Access**: Designated family members receive secure access

### Step 2: Configuring Check-in Frequency
Choose how often you want to check in:

- **Weekly**: Check in every 7 days (recommended for active users)
- **Bi-weekly**: Check in every 14 days (balanced approach)
- **Monthly**: Check in every 30 days (minimal maintenance)

**Recommendation**: Start with weekly check-ins and adjust based on your preferences.

### Step 3: Adding Family Members
Add at least one family member who will inherit your digital assets:

```
Required Information:
- Full name
- Relationship to you
- Email address
- Phone number
- Inheritance permissions
```

### Step 4: Designating Emergency Contact
Choose one family member as your emergency contact:
- They receive immediate notifications about missed check-ins
- They can verify your status during the countdown period
- They can help prevent false alarms

### Step 5: Setting Inheritance Delay
Configure the waiting period after missed check-ins:

- **7 days**: Quick inheritance (for urgent situations)
- **14 days**: Balanced timing (recommended)
- **21 days**: Extended delay (more cautious approach)
- **30 days**: Maximum delay (very cautious)

### Step 6: Final Review and Activation
Review all settings and activate your digital will:
- Confirm family member information
- Verify check-in frequency
- Test emergency contact notifications
- Activate the monitoring system
