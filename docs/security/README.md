## üîê Core Security Principles

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- **No Server Access**: Your passwords never leave your device
- **Local Encryption**: All data encrypted before storage
- **No Cloud Storage**: Eliminates server-side security risks
- **Client-Side Processing**: All encryption/decryption on your device

### 2. Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Security Layers**: Redundant security measures
- **Biometric Authentication**: Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint authentication
- **Device Security Integration**: Leverages iOS/Android security features
- **Secure Hardware**: Hardware-backed encryption keys

### 3. Military-Grade Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM**: Industry-standard encryption algorithm
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: Strong key generation from biometric data
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each session uses unique encryption keys
- **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure password generation

### 4. Minimal Attack Surface
- **Offline Operation**: No network vulnerabilities
- **Local Data Only**: No external data transmission
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only necessary device permissions requested
- **Sandboxed Environment**: App isolation from other processes

## üîí Security Features Summary
